# laserPointer

This project will be about driving 2 servos and 1 laser using a esp32 and a power supply to to point to parts or tools, I own around my garage. This project will be connected to another project called [GParts](https://github.com/guttih/gparts) which is also located on this github space.

## Development

To upload this program firmware over the air (OTA) change the `upload-port` to **3232**.  To upload this program firmware using usb change the `upload-port` to something like **COM6**, that is if you computer gave the esp32 usb connection the name COM6.
